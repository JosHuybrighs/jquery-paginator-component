###jquery-services-paginator

A jquery plugin providing the services of a standalone pagination control component.

It provides the usual pagination controls for handling server-side pagination. In contrast however
with some other pagination controls it doesn't take care of the actual loading of page content.
That is assumed to be the responsibility of something outside of the paginator, typically some
javascript component (e.g. jquery-services-itemslist) that loads page content from the server through AJAX.

The plugin of course provides customizable (UI) 'previous', 'next' and 'page' links.
